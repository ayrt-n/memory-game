# Memory Card Game

## Overview

Project for the React section of The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-memory-card) to build a memory game. Players are presented with 12 different colored cards and earn points by clicking cards that they have not clicked yet. After each click, the cards are shuffled and redisplayed to the user.

This project wrapped up a few lessons on lifecycle methods and hooks. Functional components and hooks were utilized across each of the components (App, Game, Card, and Scoreboard) to check the game state and update the DOM.

The best way to view the project is live on Github at https://ayrt-n.github.io/memory-game/
